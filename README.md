# Privacy Policy – BrainDrop

**Last updated:** 7 Feb 2026

## Overview

BrainDrop is a browser extension that helps users save highlighted webpage content as structured notes.
We take user privacy seriously and collect **only the minimum data required** for the extension to function.

## Data We Collect

BrainDrop collects data **only when the user explicitly saves content**. This may include:

* Selected text from a webpage
* Page metadata (URL, page title, timestamp)
* User-defined notes or manually pasted text
* Locally generated tags and categories

This data is stored **locally in the user’s browser** by default.

## Optional Data Sync (GitHub)

If the user enables GitHub sync, BrainDrop:

* Authenticates with GitHub using OAuth
* Stores saved snippets as Markdown files in a repository owned by the user

BrainDrop does **not** store GitHub credentials on external servers and does **not** access any repositories without user consent.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

BrainDrop does **not**:

* Collect browsing history
* Track user activity across websites
* Collect personal identity information
* Sell or share user data with third parties
* Run analytics, ads, or trackers
* Collect data in the background without user action

## Data Processing

All processing (tagging, categorization, summarization) happens **locally within the browser**.
No saved content is sent to external servers for processing, except when the user explicitly enables GitHub sync.

## Data Storage & Retention

* Data stored locally remains on the user’s device until the user deletes it
* Users can export or delete all saved data at any time
* Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data

## Security

BrainDrop uses Chrome’s extension APIs and follows best practices to ensure data is handled securely.
No backend servers are used.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated if functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected on this page.
